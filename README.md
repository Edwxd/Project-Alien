Project Alien is a game that me and a classmate started developing for our final game development project. 

Project description:

The game is an open-world survival where the main character is trying to survive and destroy all the alien nests that are all around the map. 

The main character will spawn on the shore of the beach (edge of the map) with a basic knife to defend himself and bandages to heal himself, with the goal being to explore the map to be able to find alien nests and destroy them. Now, the player won’t be able to achieve that with only a knife, so he will need to go explore the map to find chests and hidden stashes to find new gear. 

The gear pool will be composed of different types of weapons, ammo, armour, and healing items that will help him grow his power. 

The map will be pretty big, as we want to make it challenging for the player. To make it even more challenging, we want to make the map have levels of difficulty. When you spawn in the game, you will be located on the south of the map, meaning that the level of difficulty will be easy but also means that the chest will contain basic loot that is not necessarily strong. The more you go up north, the higher the difficulty, and the loot that you find in chests will be significantly better than the one down south. 

The map will be composed of trees, houses, small towns, small lakes, and many more natural objects. 

The nests will be scattered all over the map, with a total of 10 to 15 nests. Nests are very well guarded by the aliens, and as mentioned before, the more you go up north, the more difficult it will be to destroy them as stronger aliens will be guarding them. 

Now let's talk about the aliens. There will be 3 different types of aliens:

Normal: normal speed, health, and damage 
Titan: high health, slow speed, and normal damage 
Xeno: high speed, high damage, low health 

The interaction between the main character and the aliens is simple; the main character will be able to melee or shoot at the aliens, while the aliens can only melee attack the main character. This means that aliens will have to get up close to deal damage.

NOTE:
I decided to keep working on this project alone as game development is the field in which I would like to work in the future, so this is still work in progress as I have a lot to learn to be able to develop it to its full potential.
